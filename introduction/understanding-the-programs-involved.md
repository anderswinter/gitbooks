# Understanding the Programs Involved

## Virtual Reality product

**VR X-Ray Simulator:** The VR X-Ray Simulator is the simulation application itself. It is installed on a PC and connects to VR headsets using the Meta Link application provided by META (read below)&#x20;

**Meta Link:** Meta Link is an application developed by Meta for its Quest 2, Quest 3, and Quest Pro VR headsets. This tool allows users to connect their VR headsets to external devices via USB C. By using Meta Link, these headsets can function as large, virtual displays for content from PCs, consoles, and other HDMI-enabled devices. This application is required to run the VR X-Ray simulator.&#x20;

## Desktop product

**Desktop X-ray Simulator**

Desktop X-ray Simulator is the desktop equivalent of the VR X-Ray Simulator, another specialized tool used in radiography education. Users can manipulate X-ray position, exposure settings, explore anatomical structures, and practice performing x-ray, making it an essential tool for deepening understanding in both anatomy and radiographic principles.

The Desktop X-ray Simulator does not require VR hardware or the Meta Link application.
