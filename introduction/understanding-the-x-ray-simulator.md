# Understanding the X-ray Simulator

**What is the X-Ray Simulator?**

The X-Ray Simulator is a cutting-edge educational simulation tool developed by VitaSim, designed to provide students with a safe and realistic radiation free environment to practice x-ray procedures. By simulating real-world conditions as a virtual energized lab, it allows students to gain hands-on experience without the risks associated with live patients.&#x20;

The X-ray Simulator is available on both Desktop and in immersive Virtual Reality. &#x20;

**What is the Virtual Reality X-Ray Simulator?**

The Virtual Reality X-Ray Simulator is the most immersive and advanced modality for accessing the virtual energized X-ray lab. It is designed to provide students with a highly realistic and interactive environment to practice x-ray procedures. By simulating realistic and advanced interactions, it allows students to gain near-real hands-on experience with the complexity of projection practice.

The Desktop X-Ray Simulator is our light-weight desktop application that allows students to access the virtual lab. It is designed to provide students with a safe and realistic environment to practice x-ray procedures using a simplified interface. It provides students with limited controls (compared to VR) , but still offers a significant level of realism and understanding. &#x20;
