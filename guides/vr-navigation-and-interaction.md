    To move around the environment, you can teleport.

    1. Push the joystick forward using your thumb
    2. Point the controller at the desired location on the ground.
    3. Release the joystick, and you will be teleported to that position.
2.  **Rotation**:

    You can rotate your view within the environment for better orientation.

    1. Push the joystick to the left or right to rotate 45Â° in that direction.

**Interacting with Objects**
